sdb-cli: Mono Soft Debugger Command Line Interface
==================================================

Introduction
------------

This is sdb-cli, a command line interface to the
Mono ECMA CLI runtime's soft debugger. It's useful
when you want to debug a program without installing
a full-blown GUI debugger like MonoDevelop, or when
debugging a command line application.

The interface is similar to .NET's MDbg tool as
well as GDB, albeit with some differences in syntax.

Installation

Please see the INSTALL file for installation
instructions.
